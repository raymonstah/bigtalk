# BigTalk

inspired by [https://www.makebigtalk.com/](https://www.makebigtalk.com/)

This is intended to be a fully serverless application running on AWS.
The goal of this project was to teach myself a bit more about cloud native, AWS, serverless, etc

Tools used:
* Go (running on AWS Lambdas)
* DynamoDB (for storing data)
* Cloudformation (for managing cloud resources)
* Twitter API (for posting to Twitter)
* Instagram API (for posting to Instagram)
* AWS SAM / S3 / IAM for ops stuff

why?
social media is often filled with negative content. if you're gonna be scrolling through instagram or twitter, here is some content that you may find helpful in connecting with people, or understanding yourself better.
